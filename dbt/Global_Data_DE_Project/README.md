## üîß dbt Project: Global Indicator Analytics

This subproject contains our dbt transformation pipeline, modeling global development indicators from raw CSVs stored in S3 into clean dimensional models for analytics in Power BI.

### üåê Data Source
- Source: World Bank Indicator CSVs (e.g., literacy rate, access to electricity)
- Storage: AWS S3
- Orchestration: Kestra
- Query Engine: Athena

### üõ†Ô∏è Transformations
- `stg_...` models: Raw ‚Üí cleaned staging
- `dim_country`, `dim_indicator`: Dimension tables
- `fct_global_indicators`: Fact table of country-indicator values

### ‚úÖ Tests Implemented
- Not null & accepted values on `year`, `value`
- Unique tests on country + indicator combinations
